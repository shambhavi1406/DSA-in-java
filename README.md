# DSA in Java 🚀

This repository documents my journey of learning **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** using **Java**.  
The goal is to build strong problem-solving fundamentals by implementing core data structures and algorithms from scratch and practicing standard coding problems.

---

## 📌 Purpose of this Repository

- To strengthen problem-solving and logical thinking
- To build a solid foundation in DSA for placements and interviews
- To track my progress consistently and systematically
- To write clean, readable, and well-documented Java code

---

## 🛠 Language Used

- **Java**

---

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each folder represents a specific data structure or algorithmic concept.  
Each file contains:
- Problem statement (as comments)
- Approach explanation
- Java implementation
- Time and space complexity

---

## 📘 Topics Covered (and to be covered)

- Arrays
- Strings
- Hashing
- Two Pointers
- Stack & Queue
- Linked List
- Recursion
- Trees
- Graphs
- Dynamic Programming (Basics)

---

## 🧠 Learning Approach

- Focus on **understanding concepts**, not memorizing solutions
- Solve problems step-by-step
- Write code that is easy to explain in interviews
- Improve solutions gradually

---

## 📈 Progress Tracking

Problems are added regularly as I continue learning and practicing DSA.  
Consistency and clarity are prioritized over speed.

---

## 🤝 Note

This repository reflects my **learning journey**, so early solutions may be simple and improve over time.
